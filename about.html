                      <p style="color:#ece6c8">Hello! My name is Trevor Ladner, I am a Supplier Development Engineer II at SpaceX working on Starlink Product. I graduated in 2022 from Purdue University with my Bachelors of Science
                      in Mechanical Engineering and minors in Political Science, Intellectual Property Law, and Engineering Public Policy. Previously, I worked at Rivian as an Interior Materials Engineer as part of the
                      TRAIL Engineering Program until I was part of a 6% layoff in February 2023. These roles have helped me build a diverse engineering background early on in my career with experience in testing, high volume manufacturing,
                      GD&T, supplier management, and materials. </p>

                      <p style="color:#ece6c8">I previously had internships at Rivian and Magna International working on various product development roles including validation, part design, sourcing, DFMEA, and prototyping.
                      While at Purdue, I was heavily involved with the Honors College Racing Crew - a team that competes in the 
                      annual Purdue Grand Prix. On the team, I served in various roles such as Crew Chief, Assistant Director, and PR/Sponsorship Lead. In these roles, I performed 
                      tasks from budget management to overseeing the engineering and racing strategy for one of our go karts. I also served as Vice President of the Purdue Mechanical 
                      Engineering Ambassadors in which I oversaw each of the committees in the organization. </p>
                      
                      <p style="color:#ece6c8">Apart from this I was a member in Purdue Bands as well as a member of Tau 
                      Beta Sigma, the honorary band sorority. I was also the Lead TA for ENGR 16100/200 on campus. Outside of all this, I love rooting for Purdue Athletics, spending time with friends, watching any form of racing, baking, hiking, kayaking, and 
                      watching movies.</p>
					          
                      <p style="color:#ece6c8"> Feel free to reach out to me!</p>
